Consider  and  to be two points on a 2D plane where  are the respective minimum and maximum values of Northern Latitude (LAT_N) 

and  are the respective minimum and maximum values of Western Longitude (LONG_W) in STATION.

Query the Euclidean Distance between points  and  and format your answer to display  decimal digits.
